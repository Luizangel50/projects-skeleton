# Ruby Project Template

#### **For testing the setup set by this skeleton, try the command below:**

```
$ rake test
```

#### **If you get an error when executing the code above, install the gem:**

```
$ gem install 'test-unit'
```

#### **To start using the skeleton, follow the steps:**
  1. *Make a copy of your skeleton directory. Name it after your new project.*
  2. *Rename (move) the lib/NAME.rb file and lib/NAME/ directory to be the name of your project or whatever you want to call your root module.*
  3. *Edit your Gemspec to have all the information for your project.*
  4. *Rename tests/test_NAME.rb to also have your module name.*
  5. *Double check it's all working by using ruby tests/test_yourproject.rb again.*
  6. *Start coding.*

##### Note: The *bin/* folder is just a standard place to put scripts that are run on the command line, not a place to put modules.
